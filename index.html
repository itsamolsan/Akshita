            <p><strong>You are my sunshine</strong></p>
            <p><strong>My only sunshine</strong></p>
            <p class="fact"><strong>You make me happy when skies are grey</strong></p>
            <p><strong>You'll never know dear, how much I love you</strong></p>
            <p><strong>So please don't take my sunshine away</strong></p>
<hr>
            <p><strong>Your morning eyes, I could stare like watching stars</strong></p>
            <p><strong>I could walk you by, and I'll tell without a thought</strong></p>
            <p><strong>You'd be mine, would you mind if I took your hand tonight?<br>
Know you're all that I want this life<br>
I'll imagine we fell in love<br>
I'll nap under moonlight skies with you<br>
I think I'll picture us, you with the waves<br>
The ocean's colors on your face<br>
I'll leave my heart with your air<br>
So let me fly with you<br>
Will you be forever with me?<br>
My love will always stay by you<br>
I'll keep it safe, so don't you worry a thing, I'll tell you I love you more<br>
It's stuck with you forever, so promise you won't let it go<br>
I'll trust the universe will always bring me to you<br>
I'll imagine we fell in love<br>
I'll nap under moonlight skies with you<br>
I think I'll picture us, you with the waves<br>
The ocean's colors on your face<br>
I'll leave my heart with your air<br>
So let me fly with you<br>
Will you be forever with me?
